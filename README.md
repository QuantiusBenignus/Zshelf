[Zshelf](https://github.com/quantiusbenignus/zshelf) is a Zsh-centric command-line interface for interacting with local Large Language Models (LLMs) using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp). It supports context persistence, model switching, and advanced prompt workflows, ingesting from the command line, files and mouse-selected text in any window. 

Unique to this setup is the ability to have an intermittent one-shot conversations outside the isolated bubble of the lamma.cpp conversation mode: 

```
❯❯ mist 'Given the csv file sample I showed you, write a python function to convert it to binary format using the python struct.pack().
    Pad all strings in the first column with zero bytes to a fixed length of 90 bytes.'
❯❯ ls -al *.bin
❯❯ remist 'Since the file is too big, we will rewrite the first column data as a byte with the string length, followed by the variable length string.'
❯❯ ls -al *.bin
❯❯ remist 'Good. Let us rewrite the function to first sort the data and then prepend an index with the offset and record length for each 1st character.'
❯❯ remist 'Change the code to write an integer (4 bytes) with the byte length of the index at the beginning of the file.'    
```

This is powerful because one can use the shell while interacting (and affect the interaction itself) with the local LLM. All the flexibility, power and programming logic of the zsh shell is thus available in this one-shot conversation mode. For example, one can loop through all locall LLM files with the same prompt and collect the results for comparison:

```
prompt="Explain the concept of quantum computing."
# Loop through each model defined in llmodels (qlm.cfg)
for model in "${(k)llmodels}"; do
    echo "Running model: $model"
    qlm "$model" "$prompt"
    echo "----------------------------------------"
done
```

## Features

- **Zsh Completion**: Tab-complete model names (and optional llama-cli flags and options) when using `qlm` or `reqlm`.
- **Context Persistence**: Conversations saved in `/dev/shm/re*` files for resuming later with the same (or new, with reqlm)  model.
- **Flexible Input**: Prompts can come from command line, files, clipboard, or can be constructed using `promf`.
- **Model-Specific Prompts**: Each model has optimized (overrideable) system instructions (see preset values in qlm.cfg).
- **NEW: Dynamic maximization of GPU-offloaded model layers**: Based on currently free VRAM (NVIDIA only, may require extra setup)
  
## Usage

### Core Command: `qlm` (Model-Agnostic)

```bash
❯❯qlm <TAB>[ModelName] ["Prompt"]
❯❯qlm -<TAB>[-lammacli_opts --if_any -- ] <TAB>[ModelName] ["Prompt"]
❯❯#Continue the same conversation (possibly with a new model):
❯❯reqlm <TAB>[ModelName] ["New Prompt"]

```
The command uses a custom zsh completion function to TAB-complete the model name from all available in the qlm.cfg file.
The second, optional form is when the user wants to add or override `llama-cli` options.  Everything before '--' will be passed to `llama-cli` AS IS.

#### Scenarios:

| Input Type | Example | Behavior |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **No arguments** | `qlm` | Uses default model (e.g. Gemma3-12B) + clipboard/prompt file/context |
| **Only prompt** | `qlm "Explain relativity"` | Default model + given prompt |
| **Model + prompt** | `qlm Gemma2-9B "Write a poem"` | Specific model + given prompt |
| **Clipboard input** | `qlm` (with selected text) | Uses selected text as prompt |

### Dedicated Model Commands

Pre-configured for specific, frequently-used models (use without model names):

| Command | Model | Use Case |
|---------|--------------------------------|------------------------------|
| `qwec` | Qwen2.5-Coder-14B | Coding/technical tasks |
| `qwen` | Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct | General assistance |
| `gem` | Gemma2-9B | Multilingual queries |
| `gem2` | Gemma2-2B | Fast responses |
| `deeq` | DeepSeek-Qwen-14B | Advanced analysis |
| `mist` | Mistral-Small-24B | Large context handling |

Their response aliases (defined in `qlm.cfg` as anon. functions): `reqwec`, `reqwen`, `regem` etc.

**Example**:
```bash
❯❯qwec "Generate Python code for a Fibonacci sequence"
❯❯ls -al
❯❯reqwec 'Make it recursive'
```

### Context Building with `promf`

The `promf` helper function populates the temporary prompt file (`$TPROMPTF`):

```bash
# Append content to the prompt file
❯❯promf file.txt
# From a file
❯❯promf "Custom instruction"
# Direct input
❯❯promf
# From mouse-selected text (via xsel)
❯❯promf l 
#list contents of prompt file directory
❯❯promf c 
#display contents of prompt file

❯❯promf 0 #or any other single character different from 'l' or 'c'
#delete temporary prompt file
```

**Workflow Example**:
```bash
❯❯promf "Context1" # Start building prompt
❯❯promf data.txt # Add file content
❯❯promf # Append text selected with the mouse from a browser
❯❯qlm [ModelName] # Use accumulated context
❯❯promf 1 #Clear context (empty file)
```

### Conversation Continuation

Use `reqlm` or model-specific aliases to continue previous sessions:

```bash
# Continue last `qlm` session (can change model)
❯❯reqlm <TAB>[New LLM] "Follow-up question?"

# Continue Qwen session
❯❯reqwec "Next coding task?"
```

## Installation & Setup

### Requirements:
- Zsh (configured with `compinit` for the TAB completion of model names and options.)
- [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) (`llam`/`llama-cli` in PATH)
- `xsel` (or `wl-copy` on Wayland) for clipboard access (`sudo apt install xsel` on Linux)

### Steps:

1. **Place files in Zsh function path**:
    ```zsh
    git clone https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/Zshelf.git
    export ZDOTDIR=${ZDOTDIR:-$HOME}
    mkdir -p $ZDOTDIR/.zfunc   
    cd zshelf  
    cp * $ZDOTDIR/.zfunc/
    ```

2. **Configure `.zshrc`**:
    ```zsh
    #It would be best to set ZDOTDIR in your ~/.zshenv
    if [[ -z "$ZDOTDIR" ]]; then
        export ZDOTDIR="$HOME"
    fi

    fpath=($ZDOTDIR/.zfunc $fpath)
    # Enables model name completion
    
    # Autoload functions and completion
    autoload -Uz qlm _qlm promf reqlm qwec qwen gem gem2 deeq mist 

    #This comes after compinit:
    compdef _qlm qlm
    ```
Please, check the top and bottom of supplied `.zshrc` for configuration related to this tool set.
All the response aliases/functions are defined in the config file qlm.cfg.

3. **Configure dynamic adjustment of N in -ngl N for models that do not fit in the GPU VRAM**:
   
   If using the dynamic (based on `nvidia-smi` output) maximization of GPU-offloaded layers for models that DO NOT fit in your GPU:
   - Check if the `qml.cfg` file (last block) contains an array with the VRAM loads (indexed by the # of offloaded layers) for your specific model.
   - If not, such an array needs to be setup, either using the helper script `gpulayers.zsh` or manually/ via other means.
   - The comments of the last block of qlm.cfg contain a suggestion how to mock up such an array to effectively disable this feature for a specifc model. 
When properly setup, this feature will allow some flexibility and will maximize the number of layers offloaded to the GPU for maximum possible performance in the specific VRAM situation. (An example scenario is having a resident whisper.cpp server listening for [speech recognition](https://github.com/QuantiusBenignus/BlahST) and occupying about 400MB of VRAM on the GPU, in which case the number of offloaded layers when running an LLM with Zshelf,will be reduced by 1 or 2 automatically.)
   
## Configuration (qlm.cfg)

Edit `.zfunc/qlm.cfg` to add models and parameters:

```bash
# Example model entry
llmodels=( QwenCoder-14B "Qwen2.5-Coder-14B-Instruct-Q5_K_L.gguf" )

# Context size (adjust for VRAM)
ctxsize=(QwenCoder-14B 4096)

# GPU layer offloading
gpulayers=(QwenCoder-14B 99)

# Temperature (creativity)
temps=(QwenCoder-14B 0.2)
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Missing models**: Verify paths in `llmodels` and model filenames.
- **GPU issues**: Reduce `gpulayers` values if VRAM limited.
- **Context errors**: Lower `ctxsize` which competes for VRAM.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `llama.cpp` binaries and `xsel` are installed. Concerning `xsel`, the equivalent on systems with Wayland is `wl-copy` and that should be installed.

## ToDo
Create an installation script.
